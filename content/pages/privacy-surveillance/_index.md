*Author:* Will Deringer

*Lecture Module:* "Quantify and Punish: Data, Race, and Policing from the Burgess Method to Big Data"

*Keywords:* ​​policing; criminal justice; race; racism; actuarial techniques; risk assessments; big data; surveillance

*Questions addressed:*

- What role have quantitative data, computational methods, and social science played in the construction of modern systems of criminal justice?
- How has quantification contributed to the injustices of modern policing and punishment—to the creation and maintenance of a system that disproportionately and unjustly targets, punishes, incarcerates, and kills people of color, especially Black citizens?
- What can history tell us about the role that data and computation should—or should not—play in efforts to create a more just system of justice in the future?

*Author:* Dwai Banerjee

*Lecture Module:* "Big Data and Personal Privacy"

*Keywords:* privacy; AI; surveillance; data ethics

*Module Goals:*

- To find overlaps and differences in the experience of students learning about their right to privacy
- To discuss whether they believe existing rights to be adequate
- To examine whether current ethical standards (such as those instituted by the GDPR) sufficiently protect their rights (as they exist or as they believe should exist).

## MIT Case Studies in Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing

Brief, specially commissioned and peer-reviewed cases intended to be effective for undergraduate instruction across a range of classes and fields of study. Some cases are paired with active learning projects developed by students at MIT and reviewed by faculty and senior researchers.
