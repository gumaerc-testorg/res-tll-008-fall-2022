*Author:* Dwai Banerjee

*Lecture Module:* "Big Data and Personal Privacy"

*Keywords:* privacy; AI; surveillance; data ethics

*Module Goals:*

- To find overlaps and differences in the experience of students learning about their right to privacy
- To discuss whether they believe existing rights to be adequate
- To examine whether current ethical standards (such as those instituted by the GDPR) sufficiently protect their rights (as they exist or as they believe should exist).

## MIT Case Studies in Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing

Brief, specially commissioned and peer-reviewed cases intended to be effective for undergraduate instruction across a range of classes and fields of study.
